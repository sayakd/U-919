### EMC Raleigh Undeground Team
The pupose of this project is to teach everyone GitHub

We will write a script in any language you choose that will display the team's GitHub usernames.
For that everyone will need to edit the file:
`RUT-names.txt`

And insert their Name, email, and github username in the following format:

FirstName, LastName, Email, gitusername

### a script
a script will read the RUT-names.txt and display the contents

let's go!

### EXAMPLE
`$ ./show_git_names.sh`
